machine learning model that can predict whether to buy or sell a stock based on a combination of four stock indicators
Machine learning model that can predict whether to buy or sell a stock based on a combination of four stock indicators
##creating a dataset by calculating all four indicators: EMA,RSI,MACDA
After creating definitions for these indicators, all null valus i,e data preprocessing work is completed
I decided to go ahead with Random forest algorithm to create my model which in my opinion gives the best result
Also gave an Action column to decide whether to SELL or BUY a particular stock based on the decision of all four indicators
